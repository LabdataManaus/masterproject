# Master Project - Felipe Nery 
This project presents the methods used in the master's research conducted by student Felipe Nery Saldanha Braga (http://lattes.cnpq.br/9506548320723701), under the supervision of Professor Dr. Vanderson de Souza Sampaio and co-supervision of Professor Dr. Wuelton Marcelo Monteiro. The project, titled "The Effect of Viral Hepatitis on the Recurrence of Malaria Caused by Plasmodium vivax in the State of Amazonas, Brazil", was developed between 2023 and 2025 within the Graduate Program in Tropical Medicine at the State University of Amazonas (UEA), in partnership with the Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado Foundation for Tropical Medicine. All data presented herein have been anonymized, as they originally contained identifying variables, and are being made available for scientific reproducibility. The analyses were conducted using the R programming language and the RStudio development environment.
